Graceful degradation is a design principle that builds apps to work best in modern environments but will "gracefully degrade" when features aren't available to ensure that the app is usable even without these features. Service workers work between the browser and the network, which allows developers to use network requests and cached responses when the network is slow or offline. Service worker are a tool that allow for graceful degredation on the network side.
